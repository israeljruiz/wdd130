    <h2>Mr. Ruiz</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! Thank you for all of the wonderful examples of the sites you have coded. This is the fist time I've taken a course like this but seeing the work everyone did inspired and pushed me to go a little further. The fist contact I had with anything related to programming was CSE110 last semester and I loved it. Now that we are working with html, I am also enjoying it very much. There is this wonderful satisfaction when you write the code and see your creation when you run it.</p>
    <p>I have been an English teacher in Lima, Peru for the past 20 years so I am making a huge career change. I am currently working at an International Baccalaureate high school.</p>
    <p>I have been married for 16 years and have three daughters and two sons ranging from the ages of 20 to 5. One of the things I love most about life is spending time with them!</p>
    <p>I'm sure this semester will be GREAT and look forward to learning with everyone.</p>
